FSAL
=========

File System Abstraction Layer is a system which provides a few high level operations on files & folders. 
The intended utility is for Librarian & other apps to use this to perform File Manager like operations.

The heavyweight filesystem operations are performed by the daemon via XML based IPC calls.
